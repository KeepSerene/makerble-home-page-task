## Project Overview

- **Customizable Design**: Used CSS variables to store colors, spacing, and other design elements, ensuring that the color theme and spacings are easily adjustable.
- **Modern Layout**: Implemented collapsible sidebars, card-based design, and a responsive mobile menu for a sleek, modern look.
- **Accessibility**: Ensured accessibility by using appropriate ARIA attributes, semantic HTML tags, and made the site fully keyboard navigable.
- **Fast Loading & Interactivity**: Focused on optimizing the site for fast loading times and smooth interactions.
- **Responsive Design**: The design adapts to three breakpoints (1024px, 768px, and 320px), ensuring that the layout doesnâ€™t break even on screens smaller than 300px.
- **SEO-Friendly**: Included meta tags for basic SEO optimization.
- **React & Lucide Icons**: Built the site with React (+ Vite) and used Lucide React icons for visual appeal, ensuring icons are labeled with titles and ARIA attributes.
- **Form Validation & CRUD Feedback**: Incorporated toast notifications (via React-Toastify) for form validations and CRUD operation feedback messages.
- **Modal Window**: Included a modal window with accessible and user-friendly interaction.
